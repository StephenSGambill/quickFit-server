      "description": "Chest fly with suspension straps targets the chest muscles, shoulders, and arms. The instability of the straps engages the core and stabilizers, enhances muscle coordination and stability, and allows for a deeper stretch and greater muscle activation, making it an effective exercise for chest development.",

      "description": "Chest press with suspension straps targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps while challenging core stability. The instability of the straps engages the core, offers a wider range of motion, and allows for different angles to target specific areas of the chest. It improves balance, coordination, and muscle activation, making it a valuable addition to upper body training.",

The straps provide an unstable surface, requiring increased core engagement to maintain balance and control throughout the movement. This exercise helps improve posterior chain strength, spinal stability, and overall body control.",

The instability of the straps challenges core stability and forces the triceps to work harder. This exercise allows for a greater range of motion, promoting increased muscle activation and strength development in the triceps.",
